#JavaScript Quiz

This is a timed quiz with questions on JavaScript. The user will have 60 seconds to finish the quiz. If the user answers correctly they will be prompted to the next question. If the user answers incorrectly the time will be deducted by 10 seconds. If the time is less than 10 seconds and the user answers incorrectly they will be prompted to the final results page and if the quiz isn't completed on time they will be prompted to the final results page as well. 

##Challenges
A few challenges that I faced while completing this project was getting the scores to save when the last question was answered. At the moment it saves when the submit button is clicked. 

##Credits
I would like to give credit to https://github.com/pbullock08, their code helped me a lot and I used a lot of it as a reference while implementing my own code. 
I would also like to give credit to the two tutors that helped me and also Rommel and Ringo for providing me knowledge and getting me to a place where I know how to apply functions and build a quiz, even if I couldn't get it to do exactly what I wanted.
